            <p>Pickles Theatre Co is a theatre company with an emphasis on finding innovative ways for design and technology to call attention to liveness, and enhance and tamper with the audience experience. Whether this be interactivity, improvised designs or simply leading with design visions on productions. We strive to produce new experimental work that merges performance disciplines and theatrical genres. We aim to carve out space for emerging artists, particularly those with marginalized voices, to experiment with torm, play, fail, and learn—with and from—one another.</p>

            <p>I’m Chris-Liz, a Queer Afro-Indigienous artist (direction, sound, lighting, composition, writing, joy, programming) with a focus on the interplay of technology, storytelling, and audience control. I enjoy long walks on the beach, making bleeps and bloops, igniting the playful spark inside of audiences, and on occasion, instilling a sense of dread into audience’s hearts where their hope should be. Some cool projects I’ve worked on that fit within my remaining word count are: Sound Designer for Maanomaa, My Brother (Canadian Stage/Bluebird), Head Technician for No Save Points (Outside the March/Starvox), Creator of the Untitled Video Game Project (Tarragon/Pickles) and Artistic Director of P-</p>
            <p>I care deeply about creating a nurturing creative process. Something doubly important when working with emerging artists. I aim to make a safe space for artists to discover, to play, to develop to….Pickle. If we can feel safe being a little silly, I call that a win, and if we can make our audiences feel the same, even better.

          <p>The Untitled Video Game Project was an experiment trying to create a play where theatre and videogames become inseperable using a number of video game mechanics and branching storylines and improv. A chosen audience CEASELESS control of the show through reactive design, so the actors must journey and adapt to every choice the player makes, every win, and every loss. There is no turning back*, there is no taking away control once given, just like any other play, the game must go on.</p>

    <H3>they/them</H3>
        <p>Hello! My name is Izzy (they/them), and I am a recovering perfectionist born and raised in Seoul, Korea. I aspire to live and learn back in the motherland one day, but until then the Toronto theatre scene is where I want to be! I am a writer, director, and producer for music and theatre with a focus on process-based creation, practice, and performance. At this point in time, I’m most interested in developing new works, creating work with my besties, interactive theatre, musical theatre improv, environmental theatre (let’s talk), and finding work as a bartender (my email is izzyleebergman@gmail.com if you have any leads). Recent theatre things: producer for Pickles Theatre Company, 2024 Toronto Fringe TENT Program participant, 2024 Sheridan Musical Theatre graduate. I hope to connect with you soon!</p>
